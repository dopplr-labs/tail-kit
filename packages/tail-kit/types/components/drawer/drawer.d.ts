/**
 *  A panel which slides in from the edge of the screen.
 *
 * ### When To Use
 *
 * A Drawer is a panel that is typically overlaid on top of a page and slides in from the side. It contains a set of information or actions. Since the user can interact with the Drawer without leaving the current page, tasks can be achieved more efficiently within the same context.
 *
 * * Use a Form to create or edit a set of information.
 * * Processing subtasks. When subtasks are too heavy for a Popover and we still want to keep the subtasks in the context of the main task, Drawer comes very handy.
 * * When the same Form is needed in multiple places.
